# shining-force2-rom-editor

A ROM editor for *Shining Force II*, a tactical RPG released for the Sega Genesis in 1993. Written in Visual Basic 6.

The editor is almost solely the work of [Space King](https://forums.shiningforcecentral.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=8022). This repository contains a modified version for which I added support for ROMs in smd format and did some light clean-up.

## Releases

Binary versions are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/jcfieldsdev/shining-force2-rom-editor/releases) page.
